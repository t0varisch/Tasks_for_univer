#Report for the fourth program

At the beginning, the "fork()" function is called, which creates a child process
```
int pid = fork();
```

The PID of the processes in which the program is located will be output to the console
```
printf("my pid = %i, returned pid = %i\n", getpid(), pid);
printf("my pid = %i, returned pid = %i\n", getpid(), pid);
```
